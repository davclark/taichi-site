<div class="home">

  <p>Thank you for your practice. A complete session includes the
      warmup and this week's form movement. But it makes a difference even if
      you can only do 5 minutes â€“ just keep up the good work!</p>

  <div id="video"></div>
  <script src="/video.js"></script>
  <script>
      var node = document.getElementById('video');
      var app = Elm.Main.embed(node);
  </script>

</div>
