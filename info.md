At this point, many students have completed 8 weeks of tai chi via the Kennedy
Kreiger program. Whether that inludes you or not, it's a great idea to find a
healthy and fun mindful movement practice of your own! Below are a few
suggestions of where to look for a program that teaches tai chi (and sometimes
also kung fu) that you can explore in and around Baltimore (I have practiced
with the first two and vouch for their quality):

- [Full Circle Taiji](http://www.fullcircle-taichi.com/) near Ellicott City
- [Tai Chi in the Park](https://www.facebook.com/belmontparktaiji/) in
  Parkville
- [Goh's Kung Fu](http://gohskungfu.com/) in northeast Baltimore (also teaches
  tai chi)
- [Baltimore Tai Chi](http://www.baltimoretaichi.com/) various locations in
  Baltimore
- [Livingston Kung Fu](http://www.livingstonskungfu.com/) in Middle River (also
  teaches tai chi, and recommended by one of our parents)
